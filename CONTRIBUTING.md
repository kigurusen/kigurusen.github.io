# How to Contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project, it means a lot to me!
This is my personal homepage and project hub, so I'd like to at least try to do everything myself.
Contributions are mostly limited to suggestions and bug reports.

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you are expected to uphold the [code of conduct][coc].
Please report unacceptable behaviour directly to me via a method linked on [my website][website].

## Reporting Bugs or Suggestions

> ### Security Notice
>
> Never report security related issues in public spaces.
> Instead please message me directly and privately using [one of my links][website].

1. Make sure your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side
2. Check if a related [open issue][issues] exists already
3. If not, simply [create a new one](https://github.com/kigurusen/kigurusen.github.io/issues/new)
   - Provide as much context as you can
   - Describe how to reproduce the issue, if possible using a minimal example
   - Keep the issue short and concise while providing as much detail as possible

## About Content Changes

Because this is my personal homepage, pull requests containing content changes will not be merged.
If you want to improve or change the website content, here's what you can do:

- [Submit a suggestion](#reporting-bugs-or-suggestions) detailing why your change is better than the current state
- Message me using [one of my links][website] to discuss your suggestion in detail

## Improving the Source Code

Source code contributions to my personal homepage are extremely unlikely.
Before you start changing anything, please check if a related [open issue][issues] exists already that I didn't assign to myself.
If there is, please message me using [one of my links](website) to discuss the change and how to continue.
